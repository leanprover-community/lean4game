      <p>
        Game rules determine if it is allowed to skip levels and if the games runs checks to only
        allow unlocked tactics and theorems in proofs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: "Unlocked" tactics (or theorems) are determined by two things: The set of minimal
        tactics needed to solve a level, plus any tactics you unlocked in another level. That means
        if you unlock <code>simp</code> in a level, you can use it henceforth in any level.
      </p>
      <p>The options are:</p>
