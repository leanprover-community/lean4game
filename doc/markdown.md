# Styling the game

You can use Markdown in all text to apply style.

## Images

You can external images using the usual markdown syntax:

```
![alt_text](https://www.example.com/path/to/my_image.png)
```

For game internal images you can add them to the folder `images/` in your game (same place
where the cover image and world images are located). Then you can display the image with

```
![alt_text](images/my_image.png)
```
