# Styling the game

You can use Markdown in all text to apply style.

## Images

You can add images to the game by adding them to the folder `images/` in your game, and
then add them with

```
![alt_text](images/my_image.png)
```

(the game server will prefix URLs starting with `images/` automatically with the correct URL.)

For external images, you can add them using a full URL:

```
![alt_text](https://www.example.com/path/to/my_image.png)
```

Note: the `images/` folder is the same folder used for introduction images for worlds.
